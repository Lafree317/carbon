<p align="center"><strong>
Carbon is now feature-frozen for 1.0.0
</strong></p>

Carbon is a full suite intended to make Lua more semantic, expressive, and powerful. It aims to provide a set of functionality comparable to .NET, and runs on Lua 5.1 and LuaJIT on any platform. Carbon will take advantage of a few extras if it finds that they're installed, like LuaJIT's FFI, LuaSocket, and LÃ–VE.

Carbon uses a custom cross-platform loader and namespacing provider, [Graphene][graphene] along with a large set of semantic utility libraries providing object orientation, strong typing facilities, data structure utilities, asynchronous events and I/O, testing, profiling, and math utilities.

You can see Carbon's documentation at [http://carbon.lpghatguy.com](http://carbon.lpghatguy.com), which works much better than GitHub's in-tree markdown viewer.

See [changelog.md](changelog.md) for the releases history of Carbon.
