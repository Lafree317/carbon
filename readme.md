![Carbon for Lua][carbon_banner]

Carbon is a full suite of libraries intended to make Lua more semantic, expressive, and powerful. It aims to provide a set of functionality comparable to .NET.

The following libraries and functions are included in the suite:
- [Graphene][graphene]: Namespacing and loading
- [Graphite][graphite]: Core utilities like OOP, pointers, and exceptions
- [Nanotube][nanotube]: Asynchronous events and I/O
- [Chaoite][chaoite]: Oject-orientated math (WIP)
- [Diamond][diamond]: Testing, strong type checking, and profiling (WIP)

See [releases.md](releases.md) for the releases history of Carbon.
